**Design Hypothesis**

Through this prototype and the playtesting sessions coming the week after, I would answer the following question:
What visual and structural aspects should I consider in the game design process to keep the game engaging and enjoyable?

**Game story**

Hello! 
I am a jeweler. I bought a set of new jewels yesterday, and I need to classify them based on their color. Can you please help me get this done before my first customer comes into the store?

**Instruction**

The color of the jewels that should be collected is displayed every 2 secs. Remove the container cap by clicking on it to collect the jewels. Only collect the ones that match the container color. Wait for the next round of the jewels to come if it doesn't match. The number of jewels you could collect will be displayed on the black screen. Please save the number somewhere since you will need it once you will be answering the playtest questions. This game is just a prototype and there is no end to it yet.

**Playtest Questions**

1. How did you find the game story/concept?
2. Was it hard to play in angular view? Would it be better to make the camera view straight top view?
3. What was the game difficulty level?
4. Did you find anything annoying?
5. Do you have any suggestions? What can be the next level of this game?
6. Do you think the color displayed on the screen should always match at least one of the containers' colors? Or it is good as it is now?
7. How many jewels could you collect?


**Reflection on playtests**

I decided to take a different approach for prototype three. I'd like to see how far I can go with the coding in the Unity environment and to what level my idea is applicable. In prototype three, I did my best to make the game mechanics work properly, and the game's visual aspect was my second priority. Fortunately, most of my playtesters liked the game. However, they faced an almost similar problem in finding the connection between the game's visuals and the game's concept/story. 

Therefore, for the second iteration, I decided to pay close attention to the comments I received from the playtesters and I tried to refine the errors and the problems they came across as much as possible.

Some of the fundamental changes that I made to this game according to the playtesters' comments are as follows:
* Improving the environment lighting 
* Making the colors truly match the screen color
* Making the target color on the screen bigger
* Making the colors more distinguishable
* Making the balls look really like jewels
* Adding a timer
* Adding instructions and game's story inside the game environment
* Adding a start and  game over screen
* Clarifying the game procedure through the game instructions
