**Game story**

Hello! 
I am a jeweler. I bought a set of new jewels yesterday, and I need to classify them based on their color. Can you please help me get this done before my first customer comes into the store?

**Instruction**

The color of the jewels that should be collected is displayed every 2 secs. Remove the container cap by clicking on it to collect the jewels. Only collect the ones that match the container color. Wait for the next round of the jewels to come if it doesn't match. The number of jewels you could collect will be displayed on the black screen. Please save the number somewhere since you will need it once you will be answering the playtest questions. This game is just a prototype and there is no end to it yet.

**Playtest Questions**

How did you find the game story/concept?
Was it hard to play in angular view? would it be better to make the camera view straight top view?
What was the game difficulty level?
Did you find anything annoying?
Do you have any suggestions? what should be the next level?
